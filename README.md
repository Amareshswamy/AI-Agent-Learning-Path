# Interactive AI Agent Learning Path

An interactive, single-page web application that transforms the complex journey of learning AI agents into a manageable, trackable experience. This application organizes AI agent learning concepts into three progressive levels with visual progress tracking.

## üéØ Features

- **Three-Level Learning Structure**: Organized progression from basics to advanced concepts
- **Interactive Progress Tracking**: Visual donut chart showing completion status
- **Expandable Content Cards**: Click to reveal detailed information for each topic
- **Tab-Based Navigation**: Easy switching between learning levels
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices
- **Clean, Modern UI**: Built with Tailwind CSS using a "Soothing Sage and Stone" color palette

## üìö Learning Path Overview

### Level 1: Basics (9 topics)
Foundation concepts including GenAI introduction, LLMs, prompt engineering, RAG fundamentals, and tool integration.

### Level 2: Essentials (11 topics)
Core agent concepts covering agent frameworks, workflows, memory, multi-agent systems, and safety considerations.

### Level 3: Advanced (5 topics)
Production-ready skills including real-world integration, autonomous loops, custom toolkits, and deployment.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser
- No installation required - runs entirely in the browser

### Running the Application

1. **Clone or Download**: Get the project files to your local machine
2. **Open**: Simply open `index.html` in your web browser
3. **Start Learning**: Click through the tabs and topics to begin your AI agent journey

### Alternative Hosting Options

**Local Server** (optional, for development):
```bash
# Using Python
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js
npx serve .

# Using PHP
php -S localhost:8000

Then visit `http://localhost:8000`

## üé® Design Philosophy

### Color Scheme: "Soothing Sage and Stone"
- **Primary**: Emerald green accents for progress and highlights
- **Background**: Warm stone tones for comfort during long learning sessions
- **Text**: High contrast stone colors for excellent readability

### User Experience Principles
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Information revealed on-demand to prevent overwhelm
- **Visual Feedback**: Immediate progress updates and completion tracking
- **Accessibility**: High contrast colors and semantic HTML structure
- **Mobile-First**: Responsive design that works on all devices

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup structure
- **CSS3**: Custom styling with Tailwind CSS framework
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Interactive functionality and state management
- **Chart.js**: Progress visualization with donut chart
- **Google Fonts**: Inter font family for clean typography

## üîß Customization

### Adding New Topics
To add new learning topics, modify the `learningData` array in the JavaScript section:

```javascript
const learningData = [
    {
        id: 26,                    // Unique identifier
        level: 3,                  // Level 1, 2, or 3
        title: "Your Topic",       // Display title
        description: "Brief desc", // Short description
        details: "Full details",   // Expanded information
        completed: false           // Initial completion status
    }
    // ... more topics
];
```

### Styling Modifications
The application uses Tailwind CSS classes. Key customization points:

- **Colors**: Modify the emerald/stone color scheme in the CSS and classes
- **Layout**: Adjust the responsive grid in the main container
- **Typography**: Change font family in the Google Fonts import and CSS

### Chart Customization
Progress chart settings can be modified in the `setupChart()` function:

```javascript
backgroundColor: [
    '#059669', // Completed color
    '#e5e7eb'  // Remaining color
]
```
